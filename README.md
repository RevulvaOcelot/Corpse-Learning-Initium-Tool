# Corpse-Learning-Initium-Tool
Corpse Learning Initium Tool is a script that automatically saves monster data from corpses a player encounters


Just shove it in Tampermonkey. Takes 2 seconds before starting to automatically scrape to make sure the mobs are already loaded.
Click the scrape/scraper OK button to manually re-scrape the mob data.

Data viewer + other related tools soon? like everything I decide to make and not do.
