# Corpse-Learning-Initium-Tool
Corpse Learning Initium Tool is a script that automatically saves monster data from corpses a player encounters


Just shove it in Tampermonkey. Takes 2 seconds before starting to automatically scrape to make sure the mobs are already loaded.
Click the scrape/scraper OK button to manually re-scrape the mob data.

P.S. If your data gets botched for some reason, just dive through the code and change the ver variable into something else. You'll lose your data but that's k.

P.P.S. Gib Hawlk the data.

Data viewer + other related tools soon? like everything I decide to make and not do.
